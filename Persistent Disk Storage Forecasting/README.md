# Persistent Disk Storage Forecasting
The solution provides 24 hours future forecast of available disk storage using historical data.

# Product Overview
Persistent disk storage forecasting helps businesses assess their local disk storage utilization based on the historic usage pattern. This will provide businesses an understanding of their disk storage attached to their virtual machines which will help them manage their infrastructure better. It uses ensemble ML algorithms with automatic model selection algorithms. This solution provides consistent and better results due to its ensemble learning approach. This solution performs automated model selection to apply the right model based on the input data.

# Highlights
1. This solution will take in hourly cost of disk storage as input and provide 24 hours of future forecast. Automatic model selection will automatically identify the set of optimal algorithms and combine their results using ensemble learning to provide the results.

2. Mphasis Time Series Forecasting can be applied for forecasting disk storage.
