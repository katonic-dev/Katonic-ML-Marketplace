## Description
Score each location to identify locations with the greatest potential in terms of visits per hour. 

## Product Overview
Business chains have more than one location. This model scores each location to identify which one has the greatest potential in terms of visits per hour. The business can then determine which location should receive a larger budget to accommodate store upgrades. Using data input of historic store-specific performance, surrounding trading areas (competitors, neighborhoods, and demographics) drawn from a range of sources, the model outputs the expected visit per hour for the 3 years after the store opened. 

Our machine learning models are available through a Private Offer. Please contact support@katonic.ai for subscription service pricing.
