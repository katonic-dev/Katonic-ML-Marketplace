## Description
Predict likelihood of user to file a longterm disability claim in a group insurance plan. 

## Product Overview
Predict the likelihood of users to file a long-term disability claim in a group insurance plan. The model extracts and integrates relevant information from complicated insurance data. The problem was approached as both a classification problem to predict the likelihood of filing a long-term disability claim as well as a prediction problem to estimate the cost of each claim. Previous use of the model delivered highly predictive results and very closed traced the actual incidents. Also added a claim costs regression model that exhibits high performance, with an actual to expected ratio of close to 1 on average across business-defined buckets and low variance. The data in includes group plan level data (e.g. coverages and provisions, tenure, plan size, SIC) and employee level data (e.g. gender, salary, dependents, dental claims) to generate data out insights to predict the score of filing long term disability claims.
