# Interest Rate Model

## Description
Generate simulations of interest rate predictions using market information. This model has a 30-year prediction

## Product Overview
Generate simulations of interest rate predictions using market information. Since mortgage terms can be 30 years, 
this model has a 30-year prediction. The model using the Monte Carlo simulation, a simulation model that shows some
 fluctuation among three scenarios to generate a record path. If you look at the past, present and future, you have
 three curves. For each curve, you have many scenarios. This simulation generates each scenario.
