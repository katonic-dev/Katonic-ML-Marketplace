#  Ancillary Personalization

## Description
Personalized hotel & car recommendations determined in real-time through multiple booking channels encourage customer spend. 

## Product Overview
Leverage customer signals to understand customer behavior to build a marketing plan to stimulate/capture demand. Recommendations for hotels and cars are personalized in real-time through multiple booking channels to encourage customers to add a flight (paid for seating) and non-flight ancillary products to every flight booked. Those real-time recommendations are fed into the booking session online or directly to the call center representatives when booking over the phone. Previous campaigns have seen $6+M increase in incremental revenue from hotel bookings and car rentals.
