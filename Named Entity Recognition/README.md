# Named Entity Recognition App
Named Entity Recognizer App built with NLTK and SpaCy, to identify the names of things, such as persons, organizations, or locations in the raw text.

## Description
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. NER is used in many fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and it can help answering many real-world questions, such as:
- Which companies were mentioned in the news article?
- Were specified products mentioned in complaints or reviews?
- Does the tweet contain the name of a person? Does the tweet contain this personâ€™s location?
