# Email Fatigue- Opt Out
## Description
Identify the likelihood an email prospect will opt-out of email campaign

## Product Overview
When a prospect unsubscribes from future email campaigns, all potential revenue from that prospect is lost. This algorithm analyzes prospect behavior and campaign frequency to identify prospects likely to opt-out. Prospects are assigned a probability of opting out of the next mailing, allowing you to adjust campaign frequency based on mailing tolerance, maintaining the size and quality of your prospect list.
