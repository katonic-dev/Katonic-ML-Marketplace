# Late Shipment (or Part Shortage) Prediction
Predict part shortages or late shipments in a supply chain network so that businesses can prepare for foreseeable delays and take data-driven corrective action.

## Description
While delays may be unavoidable, retailers and manufacturers have the ability to manage any negative impact that delays have on their supply chain, by foreseeing and mitigating potential disruptions. The difficulty in doing so today is that retailers and manufacturers are ill equipped with a lack of forward looking information. However, through the use of AI, supply chain managers can proactively anticipate irregularities in the supply chain by predicting whether deliveries will arrive on time for both outbound and inbound shipments. Using historical shipment data and features associated with deliveries such as weather and port traffic, AI learns patterns associated with on-time and late deliveries to accurately classify future shipments into either bucket and offers the top statistical reasons why. Based on this information, supply chain managers are able to implement changes that prevent avoidable late deliveries, and to mitigate the risks that stem from unavoidable late deliveries.
