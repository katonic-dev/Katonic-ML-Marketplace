# Product Overview
Cloud compute cost forecasting helps businesses assess the cost incurred from their cloud compute resource based on historic data. This will help businesses get an understanding of the potential cost for their VM instances, clusters, snapshots, etc. to help them better plan their compute resources. It uses ensemble ML algorithms with automatic model selection algorithms. This solution performs automated model selection to apply the right model based on the input data.

# Highlights
1. This solution will take in hourly cost of cloud compute resources as input and provide 24 hours of future forecast. Automatic model selection will automatically identify the set of optimal algorithms and combine their results using ensemble learning to provide the results.

2. Mphasis Time Series Forecasting can be applied in computing the cost for cloud compute resources.
