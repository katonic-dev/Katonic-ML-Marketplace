#  Skin Marking Classification Model

## Description
To help identify skin mutations to support clinical decisions and diagnosis.

## Product Overview
 To help identify skin mutations to support clinical decisions and diagnosis. Non-melanoma skin cancers, such as Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC), are the most common human skin cancers and they are growing fast. By inputting an image (.jpg, .png, or .bmp), the model outputs a probability value between 0 - 1 indicating the likelihood of BCC or SCC skin cancer. The model does not do disease detection or symptom extraction.
