# Early Intervention

## Description
Adding to credit line management, this risk model evaluates risk at time of acquisition to periodically calculate a risk score and intervene early on to limit loss.

## Product Overview
Evaluate risk at the time of acquisition with this risk model to periodically calculate a risk score and intervene early to limit loss. The objective is to find the RPC (Right Party Contact) for the collection agency to reach the delinquent customer. The propensity model prioritizes the phone type, call time, and number. Leveraging enhanced modeling tools, an Early Intervention solution was developed for Top US credit card issuers and reduced the annual credit loss by over 15% and increased profitability by over $50 million. Additional opportunities were identified, including realignment of agents to queues, additional treatment strategies (e.g. early collections) and scope expansion to business cards and exempt portfolios.
