# MTTR-Predictor
The MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) predictor is an AI/ML based solution which predicts the time taken by a service agent to solve a specific ticket or an incident request. The solution learns the efficiency, experience and workload management metrics for various ticket types solved by service agents to arrive at the predictions. The solution helps business in optimal ticket allocation leading to a low MTTR, shorter wait time, fewer open incidents leading to improved efficiency and SLA (Service Level Agreement) adherence.
