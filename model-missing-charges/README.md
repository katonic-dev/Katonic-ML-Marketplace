# Missing Charges

## Description
Identify missing charges in a provider's claim.

## Product Overview
Identifies missing charges in a claim. The model will take all the charges on the medical claim and predict the probability that certain codes are missing. By using the input data of medical claims from an insurance company (i.e. common medical codes HCPCS, CPT, ICD10, REV, LOC), a score of every possible charge code is generated. High scores mean the charge should be on the claim.
