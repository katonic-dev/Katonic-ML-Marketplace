## Product Overview
Transaction Matrix model is used to generate long-term (usually 360 months) defaults, prepayments and delinquency vectors that are used as input to calculate portfolio value. Given the status of the loan in the prior month, each element of the 6x6 transition matrix public data (such as house pricing index, unemployment rate, interest rate, location, apartment or home, rent or own) represents the probability of a loan ending up in a certain status in the next month.
