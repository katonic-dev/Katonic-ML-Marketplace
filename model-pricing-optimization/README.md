## Product Overview
Optimize prices and monetize unused pricing power. The Continuous Price Recommender uses a three-pronged approach to identify inelastic SKUs and stores to grow margins with price increases. The Point of Sale Price Elasticity Model calculates the price sensitivity of each store, department and SKU as necessary. The Customer Behavior Analysis breaks down transaction-level basket contents, size and shopping patterns. Demographics and Competitor Intensity Analysis, Multidimensional Clustering and Price Recommendations contribute to the model's analysis.
