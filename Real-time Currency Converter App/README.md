# Real-time Currency Converter App
A currency converter is an application used to convert the value of one currency into another currency.

# Description
To convert one currency to another, we need to write a program to accept user input where the user will enter the amount of money, and then the user has to choose the type of currency the user wants to check the value of.

Then our App should just display the result by calculating the converted amount as the output. A good currency converter application should show the converted amount in real-time, which will only be possible if our program is working on real-time conversion rates.

To use real-time exchange rates, we can use the forex-python library which is used as a free tool.
