# Credit Card Delinquency
## Description
Predict the likelihood customers will miss next month's credit card payment.

## Product Overview
Predict the likelihood a customer will miss paying next month's credit card statement. The customer's email address should be the identifier (or one of the identifiers). By inputting the customer's balance limit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit), repayment status, amount due on current invoice, amount of previous statement, and the optional default payment set for the next month, the model outputs a probability score of the customer paying the amount due on the next month's statement.
