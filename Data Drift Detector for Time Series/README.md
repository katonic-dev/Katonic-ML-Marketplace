# Data Drift Detector for Time Series
This solution detects data drift over time for time-series dataset.

# Product Overview
Data evolves over time, causing a change in the distributions and interpretation. This is known as drift and causes a degradation in ML model performance. The Drift Detector detects changes in the incoming data, and provides useful insights to the user with respect to the data and model behavior. The solution can also trigger an alert for model retraining based on data drift detection results.

# Highlights
1. This solution can be leveraged to find out the data drift in time series data that may have taken place over time causing production data to vary from the training data. The solution can also trigger an alert for model retraining based on data drift detection results.

2. This solution identifies degradation in time series forecasting model due to data drift over time. It identifies data drift patterns and alerts the user about anomalies in data.

3. PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment.
