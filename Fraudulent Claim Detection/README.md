# Fraudulent Claim Detection
Predict claims fraud to enable straight through processing (STP) of payments to auto insurance claims.

## Description
While Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS) will always be required as they implement mandatory rules related to compliance, AI has the ability to supplement these systems by improving the accuracy of predicting which incoming claims are fraudulent.

By learning from historical cases of fraud and their associated features, AI applies its learnings to new claims to assess whether they fall under the same fraudulent patterns. Unlike BRMS, which are static and have hard-coded rules, AI generates a probabilistic prediction and gives transparency on the unique drivers of fraud for each suspicious claim.

This allows investigators to not only route and triage claims by their likelihood of fraud, but also enables them to accelerate the review process as they know which vectors of a claim they should evaluate. The probabilistic predictions also allow investigators to set thresholds that automatically approve or reject claims.
