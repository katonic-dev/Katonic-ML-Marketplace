# Groupwise Incident Analysis & Prediction
Segmentation and forecasting of incidents by CI, applications and criticality for efficient resource planning and management.

# Product Overview
This solution provides compositional analysis and predicts the number of incidents pertaining to each ticket group. The insights around incident distribution helps in proper capacity planning, resulting in efficient resource utilization.

# Highlights
1. The Machine Learning based algorithm predicts incident volume at group/category level. Volume analysis and prediction is based on historical incident data. Incidents can be grouped based on nature of incident, criticality and/or severity. The solution utilizes both contextual and temporal features of incidents for prediction.

2. Predicting incidents along with distribution/composition helps capacity planning, efficient resource utilization and management.

3. InfraGraf is a patented Cognitive infrastructure automation platform that optimizes enterprise technology infrastructure investments. It diagnoses and predicts infrastructure failures. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!.
