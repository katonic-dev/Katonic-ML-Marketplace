#  Edge Surveillance Model

## Description
Detect people crossing over a particular boundary line.

## Product Overview
Detect objects (such as animals/people and/or vehicles) crossing a boundary line from a distance.

This model analyzes images from a device in motion (such as a drone/vehicle or wearable). Applications for this model can be used in the following settings: for security purposes, remote border surveillance, or keeping track of how many animals/objects/people/vehicles enter an area or building, since it can track movement trajectory.

By inputting a video (mp4 or stream), the model outputs an indication that an animal/object/people/ and/or vehicle has crossed a border line.
