## Product Overview
Determine the optimal initial credit line to assign customers with the highest potential to bring revenue to the company by using the NPV (Net Profit Value) and sensitivity-based segmentation models. Technical highlights include applying non-linear squares optimization, allowing simultaneous optimization of both the slope and degree of curvature of the balance response function. Using the data input of customer demographics, bureau, and application data, the model outputs a recommended initial credit line.
