# Farm Object Detection, Tracking Model 

## Description
 Detect dairy farm specific objects (staff, cow, calf) and track their movements.

## Product Overview
Detect dairy farm specific objects (staff, cow, calf) and track their movements by using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), KLT tracking algorithm. This also extends to other object detection and tracking. The business outcome for the model includes an automated and fully integrated system for object detection and tracking to dramatically decrease the time-to-target response. By using the data input of images and video, the model outputs detected and tracked objects.
