# Anti-Money Laundering Activity Scoring
Risk-prioritize alerts generated from rule-based transaction monitoring systems to reduce the number of false-positive alerts and increase the efficiency of the alert investigation process

## Description
With its ability to dynamically learn patterns in complex data, AI will significantly improve accuracy in predicting which cases will result in a SAR filing. AI models for anti-money laundering can be deployed into the review process to score and rank all new cases. Any case that exceeds a predetermined threshold of risk is sent to the investigators for manual review. Meanwhile, any case that falls below the threshold can be automatically discarded or sent to a lighter review. Once AI models are deployed into production, they can be continuously retrained on new data to capture any novel behaviors of money laundering. This data will come from the feedback investigators

In general, AI helps investigators focus their attention on cases that have the highest risk of AML while minimizing the time they spend reviewing false-positive cases. For banks with large volumes of daily transactions, improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of their investigations ultimately results in fewer cases of money laundering that go unnoticed. This allows banks to enhance their regulatory compliance and reduce the volume of financial crime present within their network.
