# Plan Renewal and Price Elasticity Model

## Description
Predict renewal likelihood for a group insurance plan and its sensitivity to different pricing.

## Product Overview
Predict the likelihood of group insurance plan renewal and the sensitivity to different pricing options. Previous usage of the model generated an estimated annual increase in premiums by $8-9MM across a 16k plan. Using the data input of group plan level data (e.g. coverages and provisions, tenure, plan size, SIC), employee level data (e.g. gender, salary, dependents, dental claims) and agent level data, the model output the predicted score for plan renewal at various price levels.
