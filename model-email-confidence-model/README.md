## Description
Quantify the probability a specific email address is correctly associated with the targeted business.

## Product Overview
Quantify the probability a specific email address is correctly associated with the targeted business. When multiple emails are linked to one business, the model scores which email should be contacted. If a 3rd party email list is acquired, the model can be used to identify the most desirable contacts. Technical highlights include unbiased data samples labeled if an email/business pair matches or not, enhanced the labeled data sample with many string distance metrics, and trained the machine learning model with the enhanced labeled data.
