However, the proportion of churned customers is with inversely related to the population of customers alluding to the bank possibly having a problem (maybe not enough customer service resources allocated) in the areas where it has fewer clients.\n",

    "- Interestingly, majority of the customers that churned are those with credit cards. Given that majority of the customers have credit cards could prove this to be just a coincidence.\n",
    "- Unsurprisingly the inactive members have a greater churn. Worryingly is that the overall proportion of inactive mebers is quite high suggesting that the bank may need a program implemented to turn this group to active customers as this will definately have a positive impact on the customer churn."

    "The precision of the model on previousy unseen test data is slightly higher with regard to predicting 1's i.e. those customers that churn. However, in as much as the model has a high accuracy, it still misses about half of those who end up churning. This could be imprved by providing retraining the model with more data over time while in the meantime working with the model to save the 41% that would have churned."
