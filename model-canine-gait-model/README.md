# Canine Gait Model

## Description
Evaluation of animal's health status (lameness) by gait analysis to predict disease (osteoarthritis, etc.). Understand canine locomotion and gait to help determine numerous musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions. 

## Product Overview
It is important to understand canine locomotion and gait to help determine numerous musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions. To the trained eye, lameness can often be detected upon gait evaluation through visual observation. However, a more subtle lameness can be difficult to detect. Our Canine Gait ML model provides a solution to help veterinarians quantitate characteristics of gait. This can assist in the detection of subtle lameness as well as a response to various treatments.
