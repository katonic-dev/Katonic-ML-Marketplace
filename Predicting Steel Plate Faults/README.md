# Predicting Steel Plate Faults
Reduce the costs of manufacturing by automating the classification of product defects.

## Description
AI helps manufacturers significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of identifying defects of all kinds, including those for steel sheets. By leveraging advancements in computer vision, maintenance engineers can prevent defects from getting past their screening procedures, all while reducing the resources required. Computer vision has the ability to make predictions not only on tabular data but also on images.

Similar to the way humans learn to identify patterns from visual cues, computer vision will learn the patterns in images of your steel sheets to accurately classify which are defective. This augments the role of your maintenance engineers and enables them to monitor bigger batches of steel sheets. The results are used to qualify the achieved quality levels and correct any drifts in the upstream process.

With improvements in the usability of AI, maintenance engineers can now train and deploy models on their images without needing to hand-code deep learning models all by themselves. Subsequently, advancements in model interpretability allow them to leverage their subject matter expertise to evaluate how the model makes its predictions. They can then monitor and manage these models to respond to service interruptions.

As mentioned, the methods shown here to detect steel sheet defects can be applied to identify defects of any product or component.
