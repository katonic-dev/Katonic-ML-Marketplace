# Cloud Storage Cost Forecasting
The solution provides 24 hours future forecast of the cost incurred for cloud storage using historical data.

# Product Overview
Cloud storage cost forecasting helps businesses assess the cost incurred from their cloud storage based on historic data. This will help businesses get an understanding of the potential cost for their cloud resources and help them plan better to manage storage services like S3 buckets, EC2 storage, Elastic Block Store, Amazon Glacier etc. it uses ensemble ML algorithms with automatic model selection algorithms. This solution performs automated model selection to apply the right model based on the input data.

# Highlights
1. This solution will take in hourly cost of cloud compute resources as input and provide 24 hours of future forecast. Automatic model selection will automatically identify the set of optimal algorithms and combine their results using ensemble learning to provide the results.

2. Mphasis Time Series Forecasting can be applied in forecasting cloud storage cost
