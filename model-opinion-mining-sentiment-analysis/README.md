# Opinion Mining - Sentiment Analysis
## Description
Breakdown and analyze sentiment of every aspect present within a text document

## Product Overview
This algorithm takes sentiment analysis a step further by extracting each aspect and opinion within any text document. As opposed to producing sentiment scores on the entirety of a sentence, paragraph, or document, this algorithm identifies the entity being discussed, the aspect of that entity, and the opinion being discussed about that aspect. This granular approach provides a more in-depth view into customer sentiment that other models overlook.

Our machine learning models are available through a Private Offer. Please contact info@electrifai.net for subscription service pricing.
