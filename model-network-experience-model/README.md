# Network Experience Model

## Description
 Identify customers likely to upgrade to 5G.

## Product Overview
 Businesses succeed when existing customers enhance their accounts through rate plan and device upgrades, feature addons, and line additions to grow account size.
 The Network Experience model is part of ElectrifAi's propensity model suite which enhances a business's predictive accuracy in targeting optimal customers across 
 Growth and Cross Sell/ Upsell efforts. ElectrifAi's test/ control performance measurement set up shows Network Experience can likely maximize uplift and revenue. 
 This model also enhances a client's ability to predict a customer's likelihood to upgrade due to poor existing network performance.
