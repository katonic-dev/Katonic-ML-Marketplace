## Product Overview

The first part integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools and comprehensive text format extraction capturing features such as bullets and tables. The second part leverages a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract audit clauses. Inputing contract data to the model, the model outputs extracted term insights.
