# Point-of-Compromise Fraud Detection

## Description
Identify patterns of potentially compromised merchants responsible for credit card fraud and geographically map possible instances of POC fraud to streamline investigative work. 

## Product Overview
Detect compromised merchants or terminals faster with improved accuracy so networks can take timely actions to prevent more credit cards from being compromised. Our solution generates prioritized lists of potentially compromised merchants so the network can focus the investigation on the most likely and severe compromised systems. The models identify warning signs and geographically map possible instances of Point-of-Compromise (POC) fraud to streamline investigative work.
