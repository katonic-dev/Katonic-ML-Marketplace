# Bust-Out Fraud Detection
Detect and prevent fraud before it happens with this collection of models using transactional history, payments and non-monetary activity.

# Product Overview:
Detect and prevent fraud before it happens with this collection of models using transactional history, payments and non-monetary activity. Using additional data sources, advanced modeling techniques, and decades of combined fraud experience, we give credit issuers more 'lead time' to take pre-emptive action by identifying bust-out customers before they occur. Increase the efficiency of bust-out fraud detection by utilizing more data inputs and sophisticated neural network models to find more fraud.
