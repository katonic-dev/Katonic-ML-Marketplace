# Provider Clustering

## Description
 Reflect healthcare provider's actual activity and define clusters of providers by their specialty, subspecialty, patient demographics, etc.

## Product Overview
 Define clusters of providers corresponding to their specialty, subspecialty, patient demographics, etc. by leveraging deep auto-encoder and clustering techniques. These clusters reflect a healthcare provider's actual activity and, therefore, may differ from the provider's formal classification. Results of the model can be used in many use cases, from data cleaning to identifying fraud, waste and abuse. Previous usage of this model grouped healthcare providers to create a more precise classification than a specialty code.
