# Specialty/Procedure Mismatch

## Description
 Identify claims where a procedure/service doesn't match provider's specialty that may result from coding errors or intentional actions.

## Product Overview
 Identify claims where a procedure or service does not match a provider's specialty. These claims may result from coding errors or intentional actions.
 The provider specialty is defined from the clustering model. The model uses a deep auto-encoder and clustering techniques. Previous usage of the model 
 helped to identify cases when a provider bills for a procedure outside of their specialty (most likely due to coding error). Leveraging the Entity 
 Scoring model, this model takes a more granular view of physicians with a high ratio of suspicious claims.
